During the spring of my sophmore year I was tasked with designing the wings for my project team's new airplane Hermeus. This project required me to learn XLFR5 to verify my aerodynamic calculation and to hone my solidwords skills by CADing different variations of the wings. In addtion to running aerodynamic calculations in XLFR5 I also did hand calculations and graphed parameters in Desmos.

The fuselage integration component of my wing is pictured below.

In order to prepare for the next phase of my next phase of my wing desing (internals) I CADed a hollow version of my wings and ran some interference tests:
