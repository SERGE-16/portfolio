This project was a great way to start using the fluid mechanics I learned this semester in a more hands on and intuitive way. While not all of my
contributions made it into our final video the experience getting to understand our system (a weed wacker) better was extremely rewarding. If it had
to pick my favorite parts of this project it would be learning more about the engine carburator, and the engine's method of sparking which
utlizes faraday's law to induce a voltage with magnetic fields. it was intersting to figure out the speed of fluid flow throught our 
fuel line and carburator, then using that value to figure out the speed that the carburator must be pulling gas from the fuel tank, 
and from that understand how long the weed wacker lasts before being refueled.
