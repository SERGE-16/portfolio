## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/IMG_6669.JPG" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am currently a sophmore studying mechanical engineering at Cornell University. Many of my experiences lie in aerospace engineering, but my interest extend to many other fields. In my freetime enjoy reading, folding origami, climbing, and playing guitar. If of my projects look interesting to you feel free to reach out. My photography website is linked below for those interested.

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
